-- first
-- +2d reaction:
-- - kinda like the sounds, but the boingy thing sounds kind of lame
-- - vibe: kind of feels dubsteppy? ketamine-y? kind of ok
-- - should have started more basic and layered on wonky sound
-- - ~0:25 don't like sudden unexpected pauses/rests
-- - 0:45 sudden heavy distortion too harsh
-- - big gap of no interesting changes
-- - 1:40 still harsh, but more interesting variation
-- - 2:40 base level sounds haven't really changed
-- - ~3:45 a lot more high pitched ethereal bell kind of annoying
-- - going away and coming back works better if there's more expectation that it should continue

-- second
-- reaction:
-- - starts with too much stuff
-- - felt too busy, but dropping some things out felt better. like the higher energy
-- - 0:30 rhythm too irregular
-- - 1:17 weird glitchy distorted noise kind of nice. not too overwhelming, but interesting
-- - decent ending, but maybe would have been nice with more cheesy kind of fading final notes
